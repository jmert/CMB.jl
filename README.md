# CMB.jl — CMB Analysis

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jmert/CMB.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jmert/CMB.jl)

`CMB.jl` is a library of routines for the analysis of cosmic microwave
background (CMB) data. Development of features is being driven by the author's
use cases — at this time, namely the production of “reobserved” pixel-pixel
covariance matrices as used by the BICEP/Keck Array collaboration.

Design goals of this package include:

  * Native Julia implementation of core routines.

  * Numerical stability and efficiency.

  * Parallelism and efficient memory sharing.

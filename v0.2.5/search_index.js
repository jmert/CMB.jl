The metadata data will include the following fields:\n\nfields: a description of the Stokes fields for which the observing matrix applies — e.g. the value \"QU\" signals that R is the block matrix [R_QQ R_QU; R_UQ R_UU].\npixels_right: a description of the \"right-hand side\" pixelization format of the observing matrix — i.e. the pixelization of a map vector v for which the matrix-vector multiplication R v is defined.\npixels_left: a description of the \"left-hand side\" pixelication format of the observing matrix — i.e. the pixelization of a map vector w which results from the matrix-vector multiplication w = R v.\n\nThe metadata fields are loaded from datasets named by keyword arguments of the same name. Any keyword set to nothing indicates that the corresponding data should not be loaded. The data types are format- and situation-specific. It is not an error for the named dataset to not exist, and if the dataset does not exist, the field of the metadata named tuple will be filled with the value missing.\n\nThe observing matrix dataset within the data file is given by the keyword name and defaults to \"R\". It is an error for the named dataset to not exist (if not nothing).\n\nSee also: write_obsmat\n\nExtended help\n\nBackends\n\nThe HDF5.jl storage backend is always loaded with CMB.jl and is considered the native storage format. See write_obsmat for writing a native HDF5 file to disk.\n\nImporting observing matrices from the following additional data formats is supported via Requires.jl, which requires the user to first load the extra backend of choice.\n\nJLD and JLD2-flavored HDF5 files with JLD.jl (v0.12+) and JLD2.jl, respectively.\nMATLAB v5, v6, v7, and v7.3 save files with MAT.jl (v0.10+).\nscipy.sparse CSC and CSR matrices saved to HDF5 files with h5sparse. This case is supported without needing to load any extra packages.\n\nThe pixelization descriptions are imported as data format specific types. For instance, all formats support loading strings and simple numerical scalars or arrays. Additionally, JLD and JLD2 formats can load named datasets as arbitrary Julia types, MATLAB structs are deserialized as Dicts, and named HDF5 groups are read as (nested) Dicts.\n\n\n\n\n\nread_obsmat(file::FileIO.File{format\"HDF5\"};\n            mmap::Union{Bool,Val{true},Val{false}} = READ_OBSMAT_MMAP[],\n            keywords...)\n\nReads an observing matrix and pixelization descriptors from an HDF5 file. The native format as written by write_obsmat as well as h5sparse-formatted data structures are supported.\n\nWith HDF5 files in the native format, the additional keyword mmap argument controls whether the observing matrix arrays are loaded via memory-mapping or not. If memory-mapped on Unix systems, the MADV_WILLNEED advice will be applied to the arrays. Additionally, on Linux systems, the memory mapping includes the MAP_POPULATE flag to pre-fault the data pages into active RAM. The default behavior is controlled by the global Ref READ_OBSMAT_MMAP.\n\n\n\n\n\nread_obsmat(file::FileIO.File{format\"JLD\"}; keywords...)\n\nReads an observing matrix and pixelization descriptors from a JLD-formatted HDF5 file.
